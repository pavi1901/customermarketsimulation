# customermarketsimulation
This is a Customer Market simulation modelled using Anylogic
Method of Simulation - Agent Based Simulation
Concept: I have simulated a customer model for a product or service, who will be influenced by various parameters such as 
          Parameters: 
            1. Ad Effectiveness
            2. Word of Mouth
I also included the maximum wait time of the customer and maximum delivery time of the product/service, that is customisable by using sliders in the model.
